# Simple Tic-Tac-Toe
 A simple tic-tac-toe game created with Java.
 
 Program prints the game board first. Then takes an input such as "1 1" or "2 3"(inputs should be between 1 and 3). Then it starts to place X's and O's according to the input coordinates, starting with an X. After each input, program updates the game board and prints it again. When an improper input is given, it prints an error message until the input is proper. When the game ends, program prints the winner or calls it a draw.
